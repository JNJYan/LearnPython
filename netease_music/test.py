The use of independent wholesale infrastructure providers for the provision of small -cell networks
has increased over the last few years. Wireless provider Crown Castle (USA), for example, increased
its small-cell revenues by over 40% between 2015 and 201623 as mobile operators densify their

deployment costs, promote retail competition and increase service coverage.
